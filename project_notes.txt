Task1: Predict Restaurant Rating

Objective :Predict the aggregate restaurant rating

method: 
        Aggregate rating
        Missing cuisines filled with "Unknown".
        Label encoding for categorical features.
        Train/test split (80/20)
        model: Random Forest Regressor
        Evaluation: Mean Squared Error(MSE) and R2 score
 
results:
       MSE:0.0273
       R2:0.988
       Top features: votes, Rating color, Rating Text.

Observation:
        Model performed very well. Votes had the strongest impact on predicting ratings
 

Task2: Restaurant Recommendation

Objective: Recommend restaurants similar to a given one based on cuisines.

Method:
       Target column: Cuisines
       Missing Values replaced with "Unknown"
       TF-IDF Vectorizer used to convert cuisine text into features.
       cosine similarity calculated between restaurants.
       A recommendation function was built to return the top-5 similar restaurants
	
Result:
   Locavore- Filipino
   Guevarra's- Filipino
   Balay Dako- Filipino
   Cafe Arabelle- Cafe, America, Italian, Filipino
   
 
Observation:
       The system successfully recommends restaurants serving similar cuisines. This approach works well for content based recommendations.

Task3-Cuisine Classification

Objectives: Classify restaurants into cuisine categories.

Method:
       Target: Cuisines.
       Missing cuisines filled with "Unknown".
       Rate cuisine (<10 samples)grouped as "other".
       Features extracted using TF-IDF Vectorization.
       Train/test split 
       model applied:
                  Logistic Regression
                  Random Forest Classifier
      Evaluation: Accuracy and classification report   

Result:

Logistic Regression Accuracy:0.9209(92%)
Random Forest Accuracy:018 (18%)

Observation:
            Logistic Regression was much better than Random Forest
